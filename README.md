## Elucidate

Bringing clarity to healthcare. 

Elucidate, fundamentally is a framework built to bridge communication gap between test results and people. We believe in a secure end-to-end pipeline that allows people to view their test results through an app online, as well has quickly understand outcomes, NHS recommended treatments as well as things common people can do in general to live well. 

Currently a MVP, Elucidate is a web-app that allow nurses to key in test results in the Nurse layout as they are processed. These are pulled by a server and based on the results, the NHS API is called to provide value-added information related to conditions, treatment, symptoms and side effects. If your results are normal and within the given range, we provide general tips to boost living and maintaining a healthy lifestyle all based on the plethora of data avaliable through the NHS.

People can view their results as and when they please a track their history and some analytics to show changes in test results and allow them to be more informed about their health.
